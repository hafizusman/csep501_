ASSUMPTIONS:
1. build.cmd assumes the following environment variables are set:
	set JAVA_HOME=c:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_51
	set ANT_HOME=C:\eclipse\ant
	set PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin;c:\eclipse
	set CLASSPATH=lib\CUP.jar;build\classes

2. I assume that for project 1 it's assume to have some parser warnings since I've just updated the .cup file enough to get the sym.java file updated.
